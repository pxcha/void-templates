NOTES

okay, what is this package? swm is in the repos.

this is NOT:

1. a fork of swm

2. any improvement over swm

this IS:

1. swm

so.

swm uses config.h for configuration. the void template for swm does not respect that, and just compiles it with the default config.h, allowing for no configuration.

i fixed that.

if you install this from my binary repo, this does absolutely nothing compared to the original. it's the same. if you compile it with xbps-src, it allows for pre-compilation configuration.
